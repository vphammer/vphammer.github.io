Hello! My name is Nathan, and welcome to my website! Here I'll be catalouging my personal and professional work that I'll be working on. 

I graduated in May 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Network & IT Administration, and have 1-2 years of working as a network administrator. My personal strengths are related to infrastructure automation, as I have >5 years experience working with Ansible, >3 years experience working with Python, and 1 year experience with scripting in Bash.

I am certified in both basic generalized knowledge of operating systems and computer hardware (TestOut PC Pro) and more in-depth knowledge of Linux administration (TestOut Linux Pro). I also have credentials earned from working with multiple different vendors and technologies, including Cisco, AWS, Juniper, and Microsoft.

I run Linux on my work laptop, and my preferred flavor of Linux is Rocky Linux with KDE Plasma.

This website uses Jekyll and utilizes the Chirpy theme (this website's setup was made significantly easier thanks to the Chirpy Starter).
